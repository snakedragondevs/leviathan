A Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server software written in Python

This software is currently under heavy development and most of fundamentals for a server is still being develop.

**Leviathan** aims to provide a scalable Minecraft bedrock server that utilize your server capacity efficiently, and also of course to make a server with more features as possible.

## Development

Currently I'm on the middle of designing a good network interface that is easy to use and understand, credits to NukkitX rewrite for this kind of design idea. you might ask why? well because unlike java we wan't to extend it's performance to it's highest as possible (I hope), and also I don't know how Java works, so I can't compare the difference.

## Setup

Setup is not yet user friendly, you need at least basic knowledge on how this works
